# Hi Priya. 

A happy new year!
Sorry for the delay. I saw your message from Upwork on my email box.
But I couldn't reply to you because my Upwork laptop is in trouble.
it will take some days (about 2 weeks) to fix it.

I checked the 3 tasks you shared and am sure I can do them.

One question. Do you use Slack or Skype? I can reply more rapidly via slack.
Can we have a Slack or Skype for rapid communication until I fix the laptop? This will be just used in the discussion for the project.

It is my email: dmitriynikif780@gmail.com
Please invite here

If you saw the message, please reply to my email. Sorry again.
Thanks
